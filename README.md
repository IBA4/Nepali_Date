A gnome shell extension for Linux that displays nepali date on the panel.

[Forked for personal use] I forked this extension to make it simpler and remove hardcoded styles until the original project includes a preference dialog. Original project has hardcoded `|   `, white colour, etc. (Not suitable for my theme and layout ðŸ˜…) *see commit diff*

Original extension:
